NearBy
======

1. Overview
-----------

```
This simpleapp, NearBy is a simple iOS app that connects to the Foursquare api,and using the user’s current location generates a list of nearby venues, in a graphical interface similar to a flip clock.
```
```
Users should swipe their fingers up and down to move the flip, one at the time, and the flip should have a nice and smooth “3D-like” animation.
```

```
Don’t worry to much about the visuals, you can use shades of grays and simple rectangles to build most of the pieces. Also, you can use the same icon for all categories.

The files that describe better the problem and the 'final' result, is on docs folder.
